This has been a long time coming. I lost count on how many times I opened up my site in preparation for updating it. Something always gets in the way. More times than not, it's something that I can control.

So, to keep things moving along, I'm going to work on making at least one post a week. Each time I make a post, I'll update something on the site.

For now, I'm focusing on the blog aspect. I'll be adding a new projects section and an updated about section. I'm thinking that I'll use the project section as a playground for styles while keeping the rest of the site fairly clean.  

Oh big news, I have a kid now. He's three weeks old. Life changing.
