*This is the 2nd post in a short series about setting up file hosting using AWS, S3, AWS CLI and CloudFront*

Now it's time to setup AWS S3. The setup is fairly straight forward. [Check out the first post if you haven't read it yet for a bit of background.]({% post_url 2017-06-16-aws-s3-cloudfront %})

After creating your AWS account head over to the [S3 page in the console.(https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)

Once there, click on "Create Bucket". I'm not going into detail on that, because there are hundreds of guides out there. [Amazon's is straightforward.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) You can always go back and fix any problems you run into.

Just a few tips:
 * Get the bucket name right the first time. Make it make sense to you and anyone else that you work with.
 * Pick the region that you are working in.
 * Permissions are key here. You need to make sure that you can edit objects (files) from your command line. [AWS IAM is a great interface for really controlling access.](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)

*You can do all of this through CLI.*

Let's go ahead and add a file to your fancy new bucket. Click on Upload, set permissions and you are set. On the next post. I'll cover CloudFront and then CLI. Good stuff. Thanks for reading.
